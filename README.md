# analyticAstrodynamics
Matlab implementation of analytic astrodynamics for the 2-body problem: 
conic orbits, lambert problem solving, transfers between 2-body orbits, fly-bys with a patched conic approach

Features are shown in test.m providing examples for:
Orbit visualization
Porkchop plot computation
